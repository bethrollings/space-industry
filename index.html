            <div class="story">
              <h2>Space Junk: Is it really a problem?</h2>
              <p>As you read this, there are <a href="https://www.esa.int/Safety_Security/Space_Debris/Space_debris_by_the_numbers">millions</a> of pieces of junk orbiting around Earth. While space might seem like a really big place, this quantity of debris is creating a problem. Just last year, for example, an almost <a href="https://www.theguardian.pe.ca/news/canada/nearly-20-tons-of-chinese-space-debris-tracks-over-new-york-city-and-falls-to-earth-as-scientists-watched-449220/">20 tonne</a> piece of space debris crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. While cases like this may be alarming, there are far more pressing concerns regarding the problem of orbital debris.</p>
              <p>We rely on satellites for so much of our daily activity, as well as for advancement and development in science and technology. However, these satellites are at risk of colliding with orbital debris. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20130609-the-day-without-satellites">Let’s imagine</a> what would happen if satellites all completely stopped working at once. Initially we would probably notice the lack of television and radio, and the inconvenience of Google Maps breaking down. However, much more serious issues would abound. Air traffic control would be unavailable, along with the failure of many traffic lights. International communication would fail. Then the Internet would slowly begin to shut down. Chaos would ensue almost everywhere.</p>
              <p>While it is highly unlikely that all satellites will simultaneously stop working, this thought experiment demonstrates our huge reliance on these technologies. This emphasises the massive risks that are created by space debris.</p>
              <h3>What exactly is space debris?</h3>
              <p>Space debris comes in many shapes and sizes. There are the various objects dropped by astronauts, including a camera and even a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/02/spacestuff/">spatula</a>. Elon Musk has even sent a Tesla Roadster car into space. While it was set to go to Mars, it went off track and entered Earth’s orbit, becoming just another piece of debris. You can track its current location <a href="https://www.whereisroadster.com/">here</a>. </p>
              <p>However, space debris more commonly is accounted for by defunct satellites and particles that result from collisions or explosions in space. Just as recently as <a href="https://spacenews.com/decommissioned-noaa-weather-satellite-breaks-up/">10th March</a>, a disused satellite reportedly broke up in space creating around 16 trackable pieces of debris. As a result, low Earth Orbit in particular has become a junk yard for all of this debris.</p>
              <h3>The history of space debris</h3>
              <p>Since the beginning of the Space Race in the 1950s, space debris has been a growing problem. As you can see from this timeline, the space industry is now beginning to realise how big this problem really is.</p>
                <iframe src='https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=17pgzysnzxwmO4FWbdBvOHHh3QMD8gN1s1HedGZRNRCU&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650' width='100%' height='650' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen frameborder='0'></iframe>
              <h3>Why is space debris a problem?</h3>
              <p>The extremely fast rate that much of this debris travels at makes it very hazardous for other objects in space. With much of the debris moving at around <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/hq/library/find/bibliographies/space_debris/">18,000 miles per hour</a>, even tiny fragments of debris can cause huge amounts of damage. For instance, in 2016, Tim Peake shared a photo of the International Space Station (ISS) with a dent in the Copula module caused by a collision with debris. The European Space Agency (ESA) has suggested that the debris may have been as small as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/12/11664668/iss-window-chip-space-debris-tim-peake">‘a few thousandths of a millimetre across’</a>. The massive damage that such a small piece of debris can cause is astonishing. NASA has <a href="https://bigthink.com/paul-ratner/how-the-kessler-syndrome-can-end-all-space-exploration-and-destroy-modern-life">calculated</a> that a paint fleck that is 1cm wide, travelling at the speed of 22,000 mph could potentially create as much damage as a 250kg item travelling at only 60 mph on Earth. Considering that the ISS is designed to withstand these impacts, and regularly makes <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2020/09/22/station-boosts-orbit-to-avoid-space-debris/">manoeuvres</a> to avoid debris, it is easy to imagine the potential damage that larger pieces of debris could create.
              </p>
              <h3>Space law and the future of space debris</h3>
              <p>A general lack of <a href="https://www.spacelegalissues.com/the-legal-status-of-space-debris/">laws</a> on the status of orbital debris has only worsened the problem over the years. This has led to a tragedy of the commons. The open access to space allowed nations to act in their own interest, without considering the problems that they were creating for all involved. For instance, China and India’s anti-satellite missile tests involved deliberately destroying one of their own satellites. The Chinese test, along with the accidental collisions of 2 satellites in 2009 are believed to have contributed to an enormous <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/hq/library/find/bibliographies/space_debris">70%</a> of debris in orbit. Russia and the US are also known to have done similar tests on their own satellites in preparation for warfare.</p>
              <p>With around <a href="https://www.esa.int/Safety_Security/Space_Debris/Space_debris_by_the_numbers">34,000</a> fragments of trackable debris in orbit and millions more that are too small to track, it is not a surprise that programmes like the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Safety_Security/Clean_Space/ESA_commissions_world_s_first_space_debris_removal">ESA’s</a> are being planned to remove the debris that is currently in space. They have their work cut out.</p>
              <p>There is, however, some progress being made. For instance, there has been an increase in the development and testing of technologies that aim to remove debris from orbit. In a further step to mitigate the problem, it was suggested that satellites should be re-entered into the Earth’s atmosphere where they can burn up, within <a href="https://www.esa.int/Safety_Security/Space_Debris/Mitigating_space_debris_generation">25 years</a> after they have become defunct. However, while this is a step forward, it is only recommendation. There are no laws that specify exactly how to handle the problem of space debris and there is no real enforcement of the recommendation. Without any explicit laws, low Earth Orbit has become somewhat of a free-for-all, with many countries leaving behind huge amounts of debris.</p>
              <p>The space industry as a whole needs to think about mitigation of debris as removal is not a long-term solution to the problem. Space law is also in need of advancement as it is currently too vague. As and international problem, the solution must be reached at an international level.</p>
                <iframe frameborder="0" class="juxtapose" width="100%" height="618" src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=d3a97c94-90b2-11eb-83c8-ebb5d6f907df"></iframe>
              <p>Over the last 20 years, many smaller nations have become more involved in the space industry, sending satellites and other missions into space. This ever-increasing space activity is worrying, and the problem is only going to get worse.</p>
              <p>In 1978, Donald Kessler, scientist at NASA, proposed the theory which has come to be known as the <a href="http://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Engineering_Technology/The_Kessler_Effect_and_how_to_stop_it">Kessler syndrome</a>. As more and more debris collide, more and more smaller pieces of debris will be created. This will in turn create more collisions and the cycle will continue. Kessler predicted the quantity of debris to snowball at exponential rates. While some debris will burn up in Earth’s atmosphere, delaying the increase to some extent, the rate of increase in collisions will still outweigh this. If this phenomenon were to continue without any plans for mitigation, any activity in space will eventually be at risk. This would even be the case if there was never another mission into space. The sheer amount of debris that already exists is enough to sustain the problem. </p>
              <p>And with our ever-increasing reliance on satellite technology in daily life, the risks will continue. Elon Musk’s company SpaceX is in the process of sending <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-elon-musk-42000-starlink-satellites-earth-effects-stars-2020-10?r=US&IR=T#:~:text=What%20Elon%20Musks%2042%2C000%20Starlink,for%20%E2%80%94%20and%20to%20%E2%80%94%20planet%20Earth&text=Over%20the%20next%20few%20decades,from%20the%20rainforest%20to%20Antarctica.">42,000</a> satellites into space for the Starlink project. Starlink aims to improve internet connectivity across the globe. We can only imagine how this mission might contribute to the problem of space debris.</p>
              <p>As the director of the <a href="http://www.satmagazine.com/story.php?number=1796064087#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSpace%20debris%2C%E2%80%9D%20O,payload%20was%20a%201967%20launch.">US Office of Space Commerce</a> has said, “Space debris is the ‘speed bump’ on the path to the trillion-dollar space economy”. It is clear that the mitigation of space debris needs to be at the forefront of planning in the space industry.</p>

              <h2>Climate Change and the Space Industry: A Double-Edged Sword</h2>
                <p>It is well known that climate change is one of the biggest problems facing our planet today. However, what is perhaps less well known is the huge role that satellite technology plays in studying and analysing Earth’s climate. The study of global warming, deforestation, as well as other aspects of climate science all rely heavily on satellites.</p>
                <p>Satellites measure <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/nasa_science/missions/?page=0&per_page=40&order=title+asc&search="> many variables</a> associated with climate change including rising sea levels, atmospheric gas, temperature changes, melting polar ice, and deforestation. Satellite imagery is not just useful for Google Earth. It is highly important in examining changes in Earth’s structure over time and for determining which of these changes are naturally occurring and which are a result of human activity. Satellites allow scientists to measure areas of the Earth that would otherwise be very hard to <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/05/how-nasa-satellites-help-scientists-understand-climate-change/">access</a> including polar ice sheets, the middle of the ocean and tropical forests.</p>
                  <iframe frameborder="0" class="juxtapose" width="100%" height="737.0000000000001" src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=9ed249ae-90c8-11eb-83c8-ebb5d6f907df"></iframe>
                <p>This comparison of the Indonesian rainforest clearly shows the huge change in the landscape due to deforestation since 1984. Deforestation contributes to climate change in <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/explainers/whats-redd-and-will-it-help-tackle-climate-change/">several ways</a>. The reduction in carbon dioxide absorbed by trees means that the levels increase in the atmosphere. Fires are often used to destroy rainforests which also emit carbon dioxide along with other greenhouse gases. Satellites can provide us with a visual so that we can understand the damage that we are causing the planet.</p>
                <h3>What can be meausred?</h3>
                <p>Beyond deforestation, many other factors that contribute to climate change can also be measured. Air pollution levels can be closely monitored. Using satellite technology, the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-5P/Air_pollution_returning_to_pre-COVID_levels">European Space Agency</a> has recently demonstrated that the levels of air pollution are returning to the levels they were at prior to the pandemic. Changing sea temperature can also be measured more accurately since the November 2020 launch of new satellite constellation <a href="https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-6">Sentinel-6</a>.</p>
                <p>Satellite technology can also provide real time imagery of what is happening on Earth. This can be incredibly important during environmental catastrophes. For example, in the case of <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/fires/main/missions/index.html">wildfires</a>, the direction of smoke could be tracked in real time. This is crucial in predicting how fires might spread and therefore determining how further spread can be prevented. Evidence gathered from satellites can therefore be extremely important, particularly for demonstrating that climate change is something that is happening and is happening now. </p>
                <p>The visuals provided by these images help to spread awareness of climate issues on social media. Rather than just statistics and statements reminding us that climate change is happening, individuals can see the real impact of climate change on Earth. This phenomenon occurred during the 2019 <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-asia-24627498">Australian bushfires</a>. Satellite images were shared across the internet, encouraging individuals to take action. </p>
                  <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/5630604"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
                <p>This pie chart shows the rise in satellites for purposes of Earth observation over the past few decades. While the number of Earth observation satellites has been increasing, overtaking communication satellites in the 2010s, in the last year communication satellites have again taken the lead. This is due to SpaceX’s <a href="https://www.starlink.com/">Starlink</a> project that aims to increase broadband connectivity across the globe. However, the general increase in satellites for Earth observation and climate science purposes over the last few decades demonstrates the importance of satellite technology in the fight against climate change. This is set to continue to rise.</p>
                <h3>There are still improvements to be made</h3>
                <p>While there has been an increase in satellites for purposes of Earth observation, the number of satellites in orbit remains insufficient. The coverage of Earth that can be generated from these satellites at the moment is still only around <a href="https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/the-growing-need-for-earth-observation-satellites-to-deal-with-climate-change/">30%</a>. This results in an incomplete picture of the global climate situation. In order to improve the coverage, more satellites intended for purposes of Earth observation and climate science are needed. </p>
                <h3>How environmentally sustainable is the space industry?</h3>
                <p>While the satellites and the space industry are very important for climate science, the industry itself also contributes to global warming. Both space launches and manufacturing of space industry products release large quantities of the <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/space/are-space-launches-bad-for-the-environment/">emissions</a> that are responsible for global warming.</p>
                <p>For example, SpaceX Falcon Heavy has 27 engines. During take off it produces the equivalent emissions as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-01-30/space-launch-carbon-emissions">18 Boeing 747s</a>. After exiting Earth’s orbit, the spacecraft will have produced a similar level of emissions as a standard car would in over 20 years. Similarly, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket has been estimated to create the same carbon footprint as about <a href="https://energycentral.com/c/ec/surprising-carbon-footprint-space-travel">278</a> individuals might do in a year.</p>
                <p>Such statistics are extremely problematic, particular considering Elon Musk’s claims to being an important figure in the fight against climate change. Along with his company <a href="https://www.tesla.com/en_gb">Tesla</a> which is at the forefront of the electric car industry, and vital to reducing emissions, Musk recently pledged $100 million to a carbon capture <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/08/elon-musk-pledges-100m-to-carbon-capture-contest">contest</a>. This contest supports the development of technology that can be used to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. </p>
                <p>While this is a great step, it may not be the best way to tackle climate change. Carbon capture is unlikely to solve all our problems as it does not do anything to actually reduce our <a href="https://www.futurity.org/carbon-capture-climate-change-2195712/">emissions</a>. Jacobson, an environmental engineering professor at Stanford University calculated that carbon capture equipment can only capture around 10% of emission that are produced in their manufacture. Pledges like this can therefore act as a cover to make people feel as though a change is being made. In reality, contests like this are equivalent to sticking a band-aid on a bullet wound. Rather than focusing on space tourism or how we can set up life on <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">Mars</a>, perhaps we should focus more on ways of preventing further damage to our own planet. </p>
                <h3>The future of the space industry</h3>
                <p>The conflict between the need for satellites and the problem of emissions is only worsened when we consider the big plans for future launches. Launches are set to increase greatly over the coming years, with <a href="https://www.starlink.com/">Starlink</a> and many other missions planned. </p>
              <iframe title="Prediction of Increase in Launches" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-5Dhl2" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5Dhl2/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="357"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
                </script>
                <p>If the increase in space launches continues as it has over the past decade, by 2035, there will be the equivalent of almost one launch per day. While this is just a prediction, it demonstrates the huge negative impact that the industry could have reaching into the future. </p>
                <p>While these figures are concerning, the space industry in general is aiming for greener practices. For example, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/greenspace/nasas-role.html#:~:text=From%20solar%20arrays%20and%20fuel,and%20green%20technologies%20continue%20today.&text=Read%20more%20about%20NASAs%20role,in%20Technology%20Innovations%20Magazine%2C%20Vol">NASA</a> has goals ‘to purchase hybrid vehicles, increase alternative fuel use, reduce energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions, increase usage of renewable energy sources, reduce water consumption, purchase green goods, reduce the use of chemicals and toxins, and practice environmentally-sound electronics acquisition and disposal’. While this is all good, they do not make it entirely clear how they plan to achieve this. If they are really serious, they need to provide a clearer strategy on how they are going to reduce their carbon footprint in the future. </p>
                <p> It is interesting to note that while there is a lot of information made available by the space industry on their abilities to measure and track climate change and other positive contributions that they are making, it is a lot harder to find information on their own contribution to these issues. This is perhaps telling. </p>
                <p>The paradoxical nature of the space industry needs to be addressed. While the benefits that we get from satellites are hugely important in the fight against climate change, the environmental cost that it takes to expand satellite coverage could be problematic in the future. The conflicts between the need for more satellites on the one hand and the need to reduce emissions on the other must be balanced carefully with a more sustainable solution. </p>
                <p>Without a balance, the space industry’s rate of emission will only get worse. As we send more missions into space, we cannot ignore the importance of protecting against further climate change. The space industry as a whole must work together in order to combat these challenges. </p>
